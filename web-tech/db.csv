Several early recipes also include anchovies. A variety of dressings are used with this salad. Food historians do not agree on the history and composition of chef salad, much less who assembled the first one. Some trace this salad's roots to Salmagundi, a popular meat and salad dish originating in 17th century England and popular in colonial America. Others contend chef's salad is a product of early twentieth century, originating in either New York or California. The person most often connected with the history of this salad is Louis Diat, chef of the RitzCarlton in New York City during the 1940s. While food historians acknowledge his recipe, they do not appear to be convinced he originated the dish, which is more popularly attributed to either chef Victor Seydoux at the Hotel Buffalo, a Statler Hotel in Buffalo, New York or chef Jacques Roser at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. Roser worked in various culinary positions in Paris before being invited to become head chef at the prestigious 1920s Hotel Pennsylvania, where he worked for over fifteen years. Seydoux first learned his craft in Montreux, Switzerland, and continued his studies in France and England before coming to work in the United States. Seydoux's first experiences in the U.S. included positions at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel and the RitzCarlton. Although the origin of the salad is not generally known, as reported by Alice Rose Seydoux, widow of Victor, the salad was officially launched at the Hotel Buffalo. Chef Seydoux, who was responsible for running the kitchen on a tight budget, began using some of the small slices of meats and cheese in a salad that he served to select customers. When the customers started requesting it regularly, the hotel decided to add it to the menu. Giving chef Seydoux the honor of naming the salad he is purported to have said Well, it's really a chef's salad.  The chef salad probably owes much of its popularity, according to Evan Jones in American Food The Gastronomic Story 1975, to Louis Diat, chef at the RitzCarlton. Cooking a la Ritz includes Diat's recipe Chef's salad. Place separately in a salad bowl equal amonts of chopped lettuce place on the bottom of the bowl, boiled chicken, smoked ox tongue and smoked ham, all cut in julienne style. Add 12 hardcooked egg for each portion. Place some watercress in the center and serve with French Dressing.  Diat did not invent the salad older recipes exist, but its inclusion on the menu at the RitzCarlton would have introduced the salad to more of the public. It's possible that the inclusion of Thousand Island dressing is also linked to the Ritz, since the hotel also introduced the dressing to New York. This recipe, while containing smoked ox tongue, still contains the primary chef salad ingredients meat, eggs, greens and presentation julienne sliced meat, and sliced eggs.

The Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables alternating layers of meat and vegetables until the pot is full into a deep pot, then adding 1  2 dl water or white wine. The ingredients should be cut into large pieces rather than finely chopped or minced. Originally, Bosanski lonac was made in ceramic pots, that were then put in the fireplace or pit in the ground.

The classic ingredients for a club sandwich are turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. Other common club sandwiches generally vary the bottom layer, for example a chicken club or a roast beef club. Variations might include ham instead of bacon andor additional cheese slices. As with a BLT sandwich, the club sandwich is usually served on toasted bread. Mayonnaise and mustard and sometimes honey mustard are common condiments. The sandwich is commonly served with a side portion of either coleslaw, or potato salad, and often accompanied by a pickle. The coleslaw or potato salad is often reduced to a garnish portion, when the primary side item is an order of French fries or potato chips. One popular theory is that the club sandwich was invented in an exclusive Saratoga Springs, New York, gambling club in the late 19th century. The sandwich is known to have appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as far back as 1899. Fast food restaurant chains, such as Blimpie and Subway, have their own variation of a club sandwich.

Ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables, meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slowcooking, such as beef. Poultry, sausages, and seafood are also used. While water can be used as the stewcooking liquid, wine, stock, and beer are also common. Seasoning and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature, allowing flavors to mingle. Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow moist heat method. This makes it popular in lowcost cooking. Cuts having a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry. Stews may be thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing, or by using a roux or beurre manié, a dough consisting of equal parts of butter and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch or arrowroot may also be used. Stews are similar to soups, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two. Generally, stews have less liquid than soups, are much thicker and require longer cooking over low heat. While soups are almost always served in a bowl, stews may be thick enough to be served on a plate with the gravy as a sauce over the solid ingredients.";"Potato, raw, with skin,Tomato,Solanum lycopersicum,Red tomatoes, raw,Red table wine,Beans, average, canned, sugarfree"

The broth is added, and heated for a short time on the stove, without boiling. Fish solyanka is prepared similarly, but soup vegetables are cooked in the broth. The meat is replaced with fish such as sturgeon, salmon, and freshwater crayfish. Finally, some lemon juice is added to the soup. For mushroom solyanka, cut cabbage is heated in butter together with vinegar, tomatoes, cucumber pickles, and a little brine. Separately, mushrooms and onions are heated, and grated lemon zest is added. Cabbage and mushrooms are added in layers, breadcrumbs and butter are added, and the soup is briefly baked. Solyanka is also popular in the former German Democratic Republic, where it is commonly found in restaurants and available in canned form in grocery stores. The German transliteration is Soljanka.

Essentially the dish originated in the early 1960s in a restaurant called Chew Kuan as tofu stuffed with a meat paste of fish and pork, thereby earning the dish its name Yong Tau Foo, which means stuffed bean curd.  Since then all variety of vegetables and even fried fritters have been similarly stuffed, and the name Yong Tau Foo has thus been used liberally to apply to foods prepared in this manner. Yong tau foo is essentially a clear consomme soup containing a varied selection of food items, including fish balls, crab sticks, bittergourds, cuttlefish, lettuce, ladies fingers, as well as chilis, and various forms of fresh produce, seafood and meats common in Chinese cuisine. Some of these items, such as bittergourd and chili, are usually filled with fish paste surimi. The foods are then sliced into bitesize pieces, cooked briefly in boiling broth and then served either in the broth as soup or with the broth in a separate bowl. The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself served with a bowl of steamed rice or with any choice of egg or rice noodles, or bee hoon rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish is to serve it with laksa gravy or curry sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red fermented bean curd and distantly similar in taste to Sriracha sauce, and a distinctive brown sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce for dipping. In Malaysia and Singapore, the Malay Muslims have taken to yong tau foo in a big way. As pork consumption is prohibited for Muslims, halal yong tau foo is generally soy based or stuffed vegetable fritters or steamed bean curd with fish paste stuffing. To prepare the dish, these, a steamed riceflour roll similar to that used for chee cheong fun and a vegetable called kangkong are boiled to heat and soften them. The food items are drained and eaten with sprinkled toasted sesame seeds, chili sauce and a hoisin based sauce. Another version commonly found in Perak state is the soup type where the food items are served in a broth and provided with chili sauce and hoisin based sauce dipping.
